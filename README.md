# Blunder3D (name is WIP :D)
unity+wpf+blender = simple modeling tool?

# Why
Cannot get over Blender UI/UX..
why no standard UI elements, no standard file browser, no standard shortcut keys, no common features like drag n drop file to import... and much more.

So lets try making simple 3d tool using wpf as main UI, Unity app as embedded 3D viewer..fun experiment?
